# AI-Based-Coffee-Machine-using-OpenCV-MediaPipe
Overview

This project demonstrates an AI-powered virtual coffee machine that enables contactless interaction using hand gestures.
By leveraging computer vision, users can select coffee options through hand movements detected via a webcam, eliminating the need for physical buttons.

Business Problem

Traditional coffee vending machines rely on physical buttons or touch screens, which can:
* Raise hygiene concerns in shared environments
* Increase hardware wear and maintenance costs
* Limit flexibility in user interaction
* There is a growing need for touchless, intelligent interfaces in public and workplace environments.

Project Solution
This project introduces a gesture-based virtual coffee machine interface using computer vision:
* Hand gestures replace physical button presses
* Real-time gesture recognition using webcam input
* Visual UI states guide the user through selection and confirmation
