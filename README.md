# AI-Based-Coffee-Machine-using-OpenCV-MediaPipe
This project was intentionally designed to go beyond a demo by addressing a real-world problem—enabling contactless interaction using computer vision. The goal was to apply AI in a practical way that improves usability, hygiene, and user experience rather than focusing only on the technology itself.
